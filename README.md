### Hi there 👋

Full-stack Software Engineer with a strong frontend focus, a clean architecture mindset, and a passion for building user-centric, scalable software.

I work primarily with Vue.js, React, and TypeScript, and I care deeply about maintainability, accessibility, performance, and security. I enjoy building products end-to-end — from thoughtful UI and component architecture to backend systems and infrastructure.

### Selected experience

- Worked on internal and client-facing production systems as both an employee and a freelancer
- Designed and implemented component-based frontend architectures used in real-world applications
- Collaborated closely with designers on redesigns, accessibility improvements, and UX refinements
- Experience working in agile teams with code reviews, CI/CD pipelines, and production ownership


### 🚧 Currently building

- A large-scale full-stack application with an upcoming beta release, including AI-powered features
- A privacy-focused personal product built with Vue, SQLite, and clean architecture principles, handling sensitive personal data with strong security guarantees
