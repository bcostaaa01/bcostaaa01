### Hi there 👋

Full-stack developer with a strong frontend focus, clean architecture mindset, and a passion for building meaningful, user-centric software.

### What you must know about me and why I can make a great coding teammate

- 🌱 I’m currently learning new things every day...
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects that have an impact...
- 💬 Ask me about music, food, coffee...
- ⚡ Fun fact: I like to eat cookies in water...

### Selected experience

- Worked on internal and client-facing production systems as an employee and freelancer
- Designed and implemented component-based frontend architectures used in real-world applications
- Collaborated closely with designers on redesigns, accessibility and UX improvements
- Experience working in agile teams with code reviews, CI/CD and production responsibility


### 🚧 Currently building

- A large-scale full-stack application with upcoming beta release, including AI-powered features
- A personal product built with Vue, SQLite and clean architecture principles, focusing on privacy, security and handling sensitive personal data

### What I love about what I do

I enjoy building software end-to-end — from thoughtful UI and clean component architecture to scalable backend systems and solid infrastructure.  
What motivates me most is working with like-minded people, continuously learning, and building products that have real impact.

### How I like to work

- Clean, maintainable code over clever hacks
- Collaboration over ego
- Iterative improvement over perfection
- Accessibility, performance and security as first-class concerns

### What you must know about me and why can I make a great coding/team mate?

- 🤓 I am passionate, dedicated and I love what I do.
- 🥳 I strive for learning as much as possible.
- 🍕 I love to have fun and to spread a great vibe.
- ☕️ I enjoy a great cup of coffee. 

### What is the most important thing somebody from the field has told you?

- 🙅‍♀️ Avoid side-effects when writing functions - each function is responsible for a _single responsibility_.
- 🙂‍↕️ Don't be hard on yourself when an architectural/design decision needs to be changed at some point in the SDLC - it is completely normal and a part of it.
